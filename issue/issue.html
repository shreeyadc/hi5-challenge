    <h1>The Issue</h1>
    <br>
    <p>"According to the Government of Canada, almost 1 in 5 Canadian teens have been victims of online bullying on social media."<br><br>Cyberbullying is the act of spreading negativity and harming others through the internet. It can take place through messages, email, gaming communities and social media platforms where people can view, share and interact with content. Some examples include instagram, snapchat, youtube, and twitter.<br><br>Cyberbullying can significantly impact one's online reputation while causing a negative affect on their mental health and self-esteem, creating both behavioural issues and academic struggles. In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the use of digital platforms has increased, which has caused cyberbullying to increase too. Many victims of cyberbullying feel overwhelmed and unsure of the next steps to take, and often don't know how to approach for help. It may also be difficult to reach out to and have conversations with those you trust. <br><br> Click on the <a href="solution/solution.html">solution tab</a> to see a proposal for a step by step guide as to what the victim can do to recieve assistance and tackle the issue.</p>
